# internship_backend_test

This project is a backend server built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose for managing user authentication and protecting routes.

Project Structure:

server.js: The main entry point for the server.
models: Folder containing Mongoose models (e.g., User.js).
routes: Folder containing Express route definitions (e.g., auth.js, user.js).
middlewares: Folder containing middleware functions (e.g., auth.js).
utils: Folder containing utility functions (optional).
package.json: File containing project dependencies.

Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for building APIs.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for interacting with MongoDB.
bcryptjs: (Optional) For hashing passwords securely.
jsonwebtoken: (Optional) For generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

User Signup and Signin:

User Model: Defines the user schema in Mongoose, including properties like username, email, password (hashed).
Signup Route: Handles user registration.
Validates user input (e.g., email format, password strength).
Hashes password using bcrypt (optional).
Saves the user data to the database using Mongoose.
Returns a success response or an error response with details.
Signin Route: Handles user login.
Validates email and password.
Compares entered password with hashed password in the database (using bcryptjs).
Generates a JWT (optional) upon successful login.
Returns a success response with the JWT (optional) or an error response.

Authentication:

JWT (Optional): Used for stateless authentication.
JWTs are signed tokens containing user information.
They are sent in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.
Middleware: Verifies the JWT in protected routes.
Extracts user information from the JWT.
Throws an error if the JWT is invalid or expired.

Protecting Routes:

Routes that require authentication are wrapped in middleware that checks for a valid JWT in the request header.

Input Validation:

Input validation is implemented throughout the application using libraries like express-validtor or custom validation logic.
This ensures data integrity and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.

Running the Server:

Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: nodemon src/server.js (npm run dev)

Additional Notes:

This README provides a high-level overview. Refer to the code for specific implementation details.
Error handling and logging are essential for a robust server.
Consider implementing best practices for security, such as using secure password hashing and handling sensitive data appropriately.

Further Development:

Implement additional features like password reset, user profile management, and role-based authorization.
Integrate with a front-end application for user interaction.
Explore more advanced authentication mechanisms like OAuth/OpenID Connect.
By following this approach and structure, you can build a secure and scalable backend server for your application using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and continuously enhance security measures.
