# internship_backend_test

This project is a backend server built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose for managing user authentication and protecting routes.


Project Structure:

server.js: The main entry point for the server.

database.models: Folder containing Mongoose models (e.g., User.js).

routes: Folder containing Express route definitions (e.g., auth.js, user.js).

middlewares: Folder containing middleware functions (e.g., auth.js, general.js).

utils: Folder containing utility functions (optional).

package.json: File containing project dependencies.


Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Web framework for building APIs.

Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for interacting with MongoDB.

bcryptjs: (Optional) For hashing passwords securely.

jsonwebtoken: (Optional) For generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

express-validator: (optional) For validating user inputs.


User Signup and Signin:

User Model: Defines the user schema in Mongoose, including properties like username, email, password (hashed).

Signup Route: Handles user registration.
Validates user input (e.g., email format, password strength).
Hashes password using bcrypt (optional).
Saves the user data to the database using Mongoose.
Returns a success response or an error response with details.

Login Route: Handles user login.
Validates email and password.
Compares entered password with hashed password in the database (using bcryptjs).
Generates a JWT (optional) upon successful login.
Returns a success response with the JWT (optional) or an error response.


User CRUD Endpoints:
Get All Users route: Authentics User using the auth middleware. Returns a response with fetched users or an error response in details.

Get One User route: Authentics User using the auth middleware. Returns a response with fetched single user based on user ID user or an error response in details.

Update One User route: Authentics User using the auth middleware. Returns a response with updated single user based on user ID user or an error response in details.

Delete One User route: Authentics User using the auth middleware. Returns a response with deleted single user based on user ID user or an error response in details.


Authentication:

JWT (Optional): Used for stateless authentication.
JWTs are signed tokens containing user information.
They are sent in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.

Middleware: Verifies the JWT in protected routes.
Extracts user information from the JWT.
Throws an error if the JWT is invalid or expired.


Protecting Routes:

Routes that require authentication are wrapped in middleware that checks for a valid JWT in the request header.


Input Validation:

Input validation is implemented throughout the application using libraries like express-validtor or custom validation logic.
This ensures data integrity and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.


Running the Server:

Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: nodemon src/server.js (npm run dev)


Additional Notes:

This README provides a high-level overview. Refer to the code for specific implementation details.
Error handling and logging are essential for a robust server.
Consider implementing best practices for security, such as using secure password hashing and handling sensitive data appropriately.


Further Development:

Implement additional features like password reset, user profile management, and role-based authorization.
Integrate with a front-end application for user interaction.
Explore more advanced authentication mechanisms like OAuth/OpenID Connect.

By following this approach and structure, you can build a secure and scalable backend server for your application using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and continuously enhance security measures.
